## 1. Business Process (The 12 Steps)

| # | Step | Summary |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **Order Intake** | Orders arrive via API or manual entry (Create New Order wizard) |
| 2 | **Assignment** | Assign to appraiser manually, via algorithm, or broadcast to qualified pool |
| 3 | **Appraiser Response** | Appraiser accepts, rejects, or counter-offers (amended terms) |
| 4 | **Event Recording** | Every interaction logged to order timeline; internal staff notified |
| 5 | **Negotiation** | AMC staff and vendor exchange information, negotiate terms |
| 6 | **Acceptance & Start** | Terms agreed → event logged → status changed → SLA clock starts |
| 7 | **Order Monitoring** | SLA tracking, status events (manual + timer-based), document uploads by vendor |
| 8 | **Completion & QC Routing** | Order completed → assigned for internal QC review |
| 9 | **QC Reviewer Assignment** | Suggested assignment based on configurable criteria |
| 10 | **QC Review Pickup** | Reviewer picks up, or returns to queue if unable |
| 11 | **QC Review Execution** | Axiom extracts data from documents → criteria evaluated → page/coordinate refs displayed |
| 12 | **QC Decision** | Reviewer accepts/rejects/requests reconsideration per criteria; final disposition |

## 2. Critical Foundation Issues

These issues cut across ALL steps and must be resolved first — they are architectural debts that will cause bugs in everything built on top.

### 2A. OrderStatus Enum Divergence — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 0.1)

Single canonical enum in `src/types/order-status.ts`: 15-value UPPER_CASE `OrderStatus` + `STATUS_CONFIG` ReadonlyMap with transitions, labels, categories, `isFinal`. All 4 duplicates now re-export from it. `normalizeOrderStatus()` handles legacy Cosmos docs. Both frontend types aligned. Zero TS errors.

### 2B. Orphaned Controllers / Inline Routes — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 0.2)

`src/controllers/order.controller.ts` rewritten as clean controller. 6 inline methods removed from `api-server.ts`. Mounted at `/api/orders`. Fixes broken `updateOrderStatus` (was passing `{}`) and `deliverOrder` (was passing `{}`). Creates orders with `OrderStatus.NEW` instead of `'pending'`. Legacy `/functions/*` proxy routes delegate to the controller.

### 2C. Duplicate Services — ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED (Phase 0.4)

Negotiation controllers merged: `order-negotiation.controller.ts` unmounted (its 5 overlapping routes were shadowed by first-mounted router — dead code). `negotiation.controller.ts` is sole controller at `/api/negotiations`. Added `loadUserProfile()` middleware.

Remaining: Two assignment scoring algorithms still exist (`VendorMatchingService` vs `AssignmentService`). `VendorMatchingService` is the wired one — `AssignmentService` is unused. Not blocking for Phase 1+.

### 2D. Event System Not Connected — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 0.3)

`OrderEventService` (Service Bus) + `AuditTrailService` (Cosmos audit-trail) wired into `OrderController`. Fire-and-forget calls on `createOrder`, `updateOrderStatus`, `deliverOrder`. Service Bus gracefully mocks in dev when `SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING` is unset.

## 3. Per-Step Gap Analysis

### Step 1: Order Intake

| Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/orders` | ✅ EXISTS | Inline in api-server.ts L619. Minimal — no validation applied. |
| Order data model | ✅ EXISTS | `Order` interface in types/index.ts. 20+ fields. |
| Frontend orders list | ✅ EXISTS | orders/page.tsx — 1200+ lines, full DataGrid with filters. |
| Inline "New Order" dialog | ✅ EXISTS | MUI Dialog embedded in list page. Collects address, type, priority. |
| **Create New Order wizard** | ❌ MISSING | Nav link `/order-intake/wizard` returns 404. No page exists. |
| **Order validation** | ❌ NOT WIRED | `validateOrderInput()` exists but is never applied to the POST route. |
| **API-submitted orders** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | POST endpoint exists but no API key auth, no webhook confirmation. |

**Gap:** The inline dialog is functional but crude. The dedicated wizard route is a dead link. Order validation is implemented but not applied.

### Step 2: Assignment

| Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `VendorMatchingService` | ✅ EXISTS | 5-factor weighted scoring (perf/avail/geo/exp/cost). |
| `AutoAssignmentController` | ✅ EXISTS | `/api/auto-assignment/suggest`, `/assign`, `/broadcast`. |
| Frontend assignment page | ✅ EXISTS | vendor-engagement/assignment/page.tsx. |
| **Manual assign** | ✅ FIXED | `handleAssign()` branches correctly between manual selection and auto-assign. |
| **Broadcast UI** | ✅ BUILT | Full flow: broadcast dialog, API call, bids viewer in frontend. |

## 4. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (MUST DO FIRST)
> Fix the architectural issues that block everything else

| # | Task | Effort | Priority | Status |
|---|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 0.1 | **Unify OrderStatus enum** — single source of truth, delete duplicates, add backend normalization | 1 day | 🔴 Critical | ✅ DONE — `src/types/order-status.ts`: 15-value UPPER_CASE enum + STATUS_CONFIG map + `normalizeOrderStatus()` for legacy data. All 4 duplicates now re-export from it. Both frontend types aligned. Zero TS errors. |
| 0.2 | **Extract order routes from api-server.ts** — consolidate into proper order.controller.ts | 1 day | 🔴 Critical | ✅ DONE — `src/controllers/order.controller.ts` rewritten. 6 inline methods removed from api-server.ts. Mounted at `/api/orders`. Legacy `/functions/*` proxies updated to delegate. Fixes: `status: 'pending'`→`OrderStatus.NEW`, broken `updateOrder({})` now passes status, `deliverOrder` validates transition. |
| 0.3 | **Wire event system** — call `publishEvent()` + `logAction()` on every status change | 0.5 day | 🔴 Critical | ✅ DONE — `OrderEventService` + `AuditTrailService` wired into `OrderController`. Fire-and-forget calls on `createOrder`, `updateOrderStatus`, `deliverOrder`. Service Bus gracefully mocks when `SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING` is unset. |
| 0.4 | **Merge duplicate negotiation controllers** into one | 0.5 day | 🔴 Critical | ✅ DONE — `order-negotiation.controller.ts` unmounted (its routes were shadowed). `negotiation.controller.ts` is the sole controller at `/api/negotiations`. Added `loadUserProfile()` middleware. Frontend only uses `/accept`, `/reject`, `/counter-offer`, `/respond-counter` — all served by surviving controller. |
| 0.5 | **Fix orderId validation** — allow entity-scoped document uploads without orderId | 0.5 hour | 🔴 Critical | ✅ DONE (prior session) — Document controller validates entity-scoped uploads. |
| 0.6 | **Seed document metadata** — test docs for orders, vendors, appraisers | 0.5 hour | 🟡 High | ✅ DONE (prior session) — `scripts/seed-documents.js` created. |

### Phase 1: Order Intake (Step 1)  ✅ DONE
> Get orders in the door properly

| # | Task | Effort | Priority | Status |
|---|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1.1 | **Build Create New Order wizard** — multi-step form at `/order-intake/wizard` | 2 days | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Wizard already existed with 5 steps. Fixed: added `productType` + `clientId` fields to PropertyInfoStep, fixed handleSubmit payload (removed hardcoded `FNMA_1004_URAR` productType, `default-client` clientId, `STANDARD` priority → proper enum values from form, ISO 8601 dueDate, UPPER_CASE propertyType mapping). |
| 1.2 | **Apply order validation** — wire `validateOrderInput()` to POST route | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | ✅ Created `src/middleware/order-validation.middleware.ts` with express-validator chains (validateCreateOrder, validateCancelOrder, validateSearchOrders, validateBatchStatusUpdate). Wired `validateCreateOrder()` into OrderController `POST /` route. |
| 1.3 | **Add missing backend routes** — cancel, search, batch operations | 1 day | 🟡 High | ✅ Added to OrderController: `POST /:orderId/cancel` (validates status transition, records reason, audit+events), `POST /search` (dynamic Cosmos SQL with text/status/priority/date/address filters, pagination, aggregations), `POST /batch-status` (validates each transition individually, returns per-item success/failure). All with proper audit logging. Frontend RTK Query endpoints already existed. |

### Phase 2: Assignment & Acceptance (Steps 2-3, 5-6)  ⚠️ 5/6 DONE
> Get orders to appraisers and back

| 2.2 | **Build broadcast UI** — dialog to broadcast order to qualified appraiser pool | 1 day | 🟡 High | ✅ DONE — Full flow: broadcast dialog, API call, bids viewer |
| 2.3 | **Build counter-offer UI** — vendor can propose amended fee/due date | 1.5 days | 🟡 High | ✅ DONE — Wired in both acceptance pages (vendor-engagement + appraiser-portal) |
| 2.4 | **Unify acceptance flows** — merge vendor-marketplace and appraiser-assignment paths | 2 days | 🟡 High | ⚠️ PARTIAL — Two separate paths still exist: vendor-engagement uses `/api/negotiations`, appraiser-portal uses different endpoints/RTK mutations. Not merged. |
| 2.5 | **Add fee/SLA fields to AppraiserAssignment** — enable negotiation on appraiser assignments | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | ✅ DONE — Full fields: proposedFee, agreedFee, counterOfferFee, slaDeadline, etc. |
| 2.6 | **Wire SLA clock start** — when order → ACCEPTED, call `SLATrackingService.startTracking()` | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | ✅ DONE — `startSLATracking()` fires in order controller on acceptance |

## 5. Phase Details

### Phase 0.1 — Unify OrderStatus

**Decision needed:** One canonical set of statuses that covers the full lifecycle.

Proposed unified `OrderStatus` (UPPER_CASE, 15 values):

```
NEW                    → Order just created
PENDING_ASSIGNMENT     → Awaiting assignment to appraiser
ASSIGNED               → Assigned, awaiting appraiser response
PENDING_ACCEPTANCE     → Broadcast to pool, awaiting bids
ACCEPTED               → Appraiser accepted, work not started
IN_PROGRESS            → Appraiser actively working
INSPECTION_SCHEDULED   → Inspection date set
INSPECTION_COMPLETED   → Inspection done, report pending
SUBMITTED              → Deliverables uploaded, ready for QC
QC_REVIEW              → Under internal quality review
REVISION_REQUESTED     → QC found issues, sent back to appraiser
COMPLETED              → QC approved
DELIVERED              → Delivered to client
CANCELLED              → Cancelled at any point
ON_HOLD                → Paused for any reason
```

Mapping from existing lowercase values:
- `new` → `NEW`
- `assigned` → `ASSIGNED`
- `accepted` → `ACCEPTED`
- `scheduled` → `INSPECTION_SCHEDULED`
- `inspected` → `INSPECTION_COMPLETED`
- `in_progress` → `IN_PROGRESS`
- `submitted` → `SUBMITTED`
- `in_qc` → `QC_REVIEW`
- `revision_requested` → `REVISION_REQUESTED`
- `completed` → `COMPLETED`
- `delivered` → `DELIVERED`
- `cancelled` → `CANCELLED`
- `on_hold` → `ON_HOLD`

### Phase 0.5 — Fix Document Upload Validation

The current upload handler in `document.controller.ts` requires `orderId`. For vendor/appraiser document uploads, `entityType` + `entityId` should be sufficient.

```
Current:  if (!orderId) → 400 error
Proposed: if (!orderId && !(entityType && entityId)) → 400 error
```

### Phase 3.1 — Order Timeline API

New endpoint: `GET /api/orders/:orderId/timeline`

Query the `audit-trail` Cosmos container for all events where `entityId === orderId`, sorted by timestamp. Return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "events": [
    { "timestamp": "...", "eventType": "ORDER_CREATED", "actor": "...", "details": "..." },
    { "timestamp": "...", "eventType": "STATUS_CHANGED", "actor": "...", "details": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 5.2 — Axiom → QC Bridge

Currently the `QCExecutionEngine` uses a generic LLM for question evaluation. The Axiom service independently stores evaluation results in the `aiInsights` container with:
- Extracted property data (address, sqft, beds, baths)
- Comparable analysis (prices, distances, adjustments)
- USPAP compliance findings
- Document references (page, section, coordinates)

**Bridge approach:**
1. Before QC execution, fetch Axiom results for the order's documents
2. Inject Axiom-extracted data into the execution context
3. For each checklist question that has an Axiom-relevant data requirement, use the extracted data instead of re-analyzing via generic LLM
4. Preserve Axiom's document references (page/section/coordinates) in the QC result items

### Phase 7 — Photo Intelligence & Image Processing (Full Detail)

**Library:** `sharp` v0.34.5 (already installed, verified working on Windows)

#### 7A.1 — `image-processing.ts` Core Utility

Single file: `src/utils/image-processing.ts`. Wraps `sharp` with domain-specific methods:

```typescript
// Core functions to implement:
export class ImageProcessingService {
  // Metadata & Validation
  async getImageMetadata(buffer: Buffer): Promise<ImageMetadata>      // width, height, format, size, hasAlpha, orientation
  async extractExifData(buffer: Buffer): Promise<PhotoExifData>        // GPS, timestamp, camera, lens, exposure, ISO
  async validateResolution(buffer: Buffer, minWidth: number, minHeight: number): Promise<ValidationResult>
  
  // Transformation
  async autoRotate(buffer: Buffer): Promise<Buffer>                    // Apply EXIF orientation, strip tag
  async generateThumbnail(buffer: Buffer, width: number, height: number): Promise<Buffer>  // Fit-inside resize
  async convertToJpeg(buffer: Buffer, quality?: number): Promise<Buffer>  // HEIC/PNG/WebP → JPEG
  async applyWatermark(buffer: Buffer, text: string, options?: WatermarkOptions): Promise<Buffer>
  async applyLogoWatermark(buffer: Buffer, logoPng: Buffer, options?: LogoWatermarkOptions): Promise<Buffer>
  
  // Analysis
  async computePerceptualHash(buffer: Buffer): Promise<string>         // 64-bit hex string
  async compareHashes(hash1: string, hash2: string): Promise<number>   // Hamming distance → similarity %
  async extractDominantColors(buffer: Buffer, count?: number): Promise<DominantColor[]>  // hex + percentage
  
  // Pipeline (all-in-one for upload flow)
  async processUpload(buffer: Buffer, options: ProcessingOptions): Promise<ProcessedImage>
  // Returns: { original: Buffer, rotated: Buffer, thumbnailLarge: Buffer, thumbnailSmall: Buffer,
  //           metadata: ImageMetadata, exif: PhotoExifData, pHash: string, dominantColors: DominantColor[],
  //           format: string, wasConverted: boolean, wasRotated: boolean }
}
```

#### 7A.7 — Perceptual Hashing Strategy

Using sharp to implement a lightweight pHash:
1. Resize image to 32×32 grayscale
2. Apply DCT (discrete cosine transform) — or simplified: compute mean brightness
3. Generate 64-bit hash: each bit = 1 if pixel > mean, 0 otherwise
4. Compare two hashes via Hamming distance: `< 10` bits different = likely duplicate
5. Store as hex string in Cosmos photo record (16 chars)

This approach is efficient (sharp does the resize, JS does the hashing) and catches:
- Same photo at different resolutions
- Same photo with minor crop/rotation
- Same photo with slight color adjustment

#### 7B.1 — Expanded `InspectionPhoto` Type

## Current Status & Next Steps

> Updated: February 20, 2026 — Plan updated with Axiom submission, monitoring, and delivery phases

### Completed
- ✅ **Phase 0** — All 6 foundation issues resolved (0.1–0.6)
- ✅ **Phase 1** — Order Intake complete (wizard, validation, cancel/search/batch)
- ✅ **Phase 3** — Order Lifecycle & Events complete (timeline API/UI, SLA monitoring, overdue detection)
- ✅ **Phase 4** — Notifications & Real-time complete (in-app API, bell/panel, orchestrator, preferences UI, Web PubSub)
- ✅ **Communication controller** — `@ts-nocheck` removed, type mismatches fixed, all endpoints properly typed
- ✅ **Infrastructure** — Service Bus + Web PubSub Bicep with Managed Identity RBAC
- ✅ **Axiom mock responses** — 8 evaluation criteria with realistic property/comp data
- ✅ **Payment provider abstraction** — PaymentProvider interface + MockProvider + StripeProvider (SDK code ready, 3-step activation)
- ✅ **Document management** — Upload, list, download, preview working end-to-end. DocumentPanel wired in OrderDetailPage + OrderTabs. Category normalisation fixed. SHA-256 content hashing on upload.

### Mostly Complete (1 task remaining)
- ⚠️ **Phase 2** — Assignment & Acceptance: **5 of 6 done**. Remaining: **2.4** (unify acceptance flows — two parallel paths still exist)

### In Progress — Phase 5 (QC Review) — Needs Significant Work
| Task | Status | Blocker |
|------|--------|---------|
| 5.1 Auto-route to QC | ✅ Done | — |
| 5.2 Axiom → QC bridge | ⚠️ Partial | Execution engine never reads stored Axiom data |
| 5.3 QC assignment dialog | ✅ Done | — |
| 5.4 PDF highlighting | ✅ Done | — |
| 5.5 QC rules persistence | ❌ Not done | Zero backend CRUD — entire feature is local-state mocks |
| 5.6 Return to queue | ✅ Done | — |
| 5.7 Final review decision | ✅ Done | — |
| 5.8 Reconsideration routing | ⚠️ Partial | Basic rejection→revision exists; no dedicated reconsideration flow |
| 5.9 Real QC dashboard | ✅ Done | — |

**Phase 5 Remaining Work:** Task 5.5 (QC rules persistence) has zero backend implementation. Task 5.2 (Axiom→QC bridge) needs execution engine to read stored Axiom data. Task 5.8 (reconsideration routing) needs a dedicated flow.

### Not Started
- ❌ **Phase 6** — Polish & Production Readiness: 6.1 (appraiser auth), 6.2 (dead code cleanup), 6.3 (real scoring). Only 6.4 (vendor rejection dialog) is done.
- ⬜ **Phase 7** — Photo Intelligence & Image Processing (59 tasks, ~44 days)
- ⬜ **Phase 8** — Axiom Submission & Progress Monitoring (NEW — see below)
- ⬜ **Phase 9** — Final Report Assembly & Delivery (NEW — see below)

---

## Phase 8: Axiom Document Submission & Progress Monitoring (Steps 8, 11)
> Submit appraisal documents to Axiom for AI analysis and monitor processing

### What Already Exists

| Layer | Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend | `AxiomService` (688 lines) | ✅ Service exists | `notifyDocumentUpload()`, `getEvaluation()`, `getEvaluationById()`, `handleWebhook()`, `compareDocuments()`. Mock mode when `AXIOM_API_BASE_URL` unset. Stores results in Cosmos `aiInsights` container. |
| Backend | `AxiomController` (391 lines) | ✅ Controller exists | Routes: `GET /api/axiom/status`, `POST /api/axiom/documents`, `GET /api/axiom/evaluations/order/:orderId`, `GET /api/axiom/evaluations/:evaluationId`, `POST /api/axiom/webhook`, `POST /api/axiom/documents/compare`. |
| Backend | Axiom router | ✅ Mounted | `createAxiomRouter()` exported and mounted in api-server. |
| Frontend | `axiomApi.ts` (255 lines) | ✅ RTK Query exists | `useAnalyzeDocumentMutation`, `useGetAxiomEvaluationQuery` (with 2s polling), `useGetOrderEvaluationsQuery`, `useCompareDocumentsMutation`, etc. |
| Frontend | `axiom.types.ts` (599 lines) | ✅ Types exist | Full Axiom types: evaluation, criteria, comparison, enrichment, complexity scoring. |
| Frontend | `axiom.service.ts` (frontend) | ✅ Client exists | Direct Axiom API client (bypasses backend — for future direct-connect use cases). |

### What's Missing

| # | Task | Effort | Priority | Detail |
|---|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 8.1 | **"Submit to Axiom" button in DocumentPanel** | 1 day | 🔴 Critical | When a document is uploaded (category = appraisal-report), show a "Submit for AI Analysis" action button. Clicking it calls `useAnalyzeDocumentMutation` with the document's blob URL + orderId. Button state: idle → submitting → submitted (with evaluationId). |
| 8.2 | **Auto-submit on upload (configurable)** | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | Option to auto-call Axiom when an `appraisal-report` document is uploaded. Backend: after successful upload in `document.controller.ts`, if category is appraisal-report, call `axiomService.notifyDocumentUpload()`. Store returned `evaluationId` on the document's Cosmos record. |
| 8.3 | **Axiom processing status indicator on document** | 1 day | 🔴 Critical | In `DocumentListItem`, show a badge/chip for Axiom status: `⏳ Processing`, `✅ Analysis Complete`, `❌ Analysis Failed`, `—` (not submitted). Fetch from `evaluationId` stored on document or from `GET /api/axiom/evaluations/order/:orderId`. |
| 8.4 | **Axiom progress panel in Order Detail** | 1.5 days | 🔴 Critical | New sub-section or card in the Order Detail page (or a collapsible panel in the Documents tab) showing: current Axiom evaluation status, processing start time, estimated completion, criteria evaluated count, overall risk score (when complete). Uses `useGetOrderEvaluationsQuery(orderId)` with polling. |
| 8.5 | **Progress polling / WebSocket push** | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | The RTK Query hook already polls every 2s while status is `processing`. Enhance: when webhook fires (`POST /api/axiom/webhook`), push a Web PubSub notification so frontend can instantly refetch instead of waiting for next poll. Wire into existing `NotificationOrchestrator`. |
| 8.6 | **Mock Axiom flow for development** | 1 day | 🟡 High | When Axiom is not configured (`AXIOM_API_BASE_URL` unset), the mock currently returns instant results. Enhance: simulate realistic async flow — `notifyDocumentUpload` returns evaluationId, status stays `processing` for 5-10 seconds (configurable via `AXIOM_MOCK_DELAY_MS`), then transitions to `completed` with full mock criteria. This lets us test the progress UI without Axiom. |
| 8.7 | **Axiom submission from QC routing** | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | When order transitions to `SUBMITTED` (Step 8), auto-submit the primary appraisal document to Axiom if not already submitted. Wire into the existing `auto-route to QC` logic in the order controller (Phase 5.1). |
| 8.8 | **Axiom results summary in QC queue** | 0.5 day | 🟡 Medium | In the QC queue table, show a column for Axiom risk score and status (completed/pending/none). Helps reviewers prioritise high-risk orders. |

#### Phase 8 Summary

| Category | Tasks | Estimated Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend — submit UI | 8.1 | 1 day |
| Backend — auto-submit | 8.2, 8.7 | 1 day |
| Frontend — progress/monitoring | 8.3, 8.4 | 2.5 days |
| Real-time + mock | 8.5, 8.6 | 1.5 days |
| QC integration | 8.8 | 0.5 day |
| **TOTAL** | **8 tasks** | **~6.5 days** |

**Recommended execution order:**
1. **8.6** (mock async flow) — get testable feedback loop without real Axiom
2. **8.1** (submit button) → **8.2** (auto-submit on upload) → **8.7** (auto-submit on QC routing)
3. **8.3** (status badge) → **8.4** (progress panel)
4. **8.5** (WebSocket push) → **8.8** (QC queue column)

---

## Phase 9: Final Report Assembly & Client Delivery (Step 12 → Post-QC)
> Assemble approved documents into a delivery package and deliver to client/lender

### What Already Exists

| Layer | Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend | `DeliveryWorkflowService` (540+ lines) | ✅ Service exists | `uploadDocument()`, `getOrderDocuments()`, `reviewDocument()`, `createDeliveryPackage()`, `acknowledgeDeliveryPackage()`, `createRevisionRequest()`, `resolveRevisionRequest()`, `getOrderDeliveryPackages()`, `completeOrderDelivery()`. Uses Cosmos `deliveryPackages` container. |
| Backend | `OrderController.deliverOrder()` | ✅ Endpoint exists | `POST /api/orders/:orderId/deliver` — validates status transition → DELIVERED, records reportUrl + deliveryNotes, fires audit event. |
| Backend | `DeliveryPackage` type | ✅ Type exists | In `order-progress.types.ts` — id, orderId, tenantId, documents[], status, createdAt, deliveredAt, acknowledgedAt, notes. |
| Frontend | `DeliveryPackage/index.tsx` (153 lines) | ⚠️ Exists but basic | Shows completion status card + DocumentPanel (read-only when completed). Has "Download Complete Package" button (TODO stub). Has TS error: `readOnly` prop not on `DocumentPanelProps`. |
| Frontend | RTK Query | ⚠️ Partial | `useDeliverOrderMutation` likely exists via order API, but no dedicated delivery package endpoints (create, list, acknowledge). |

### What's Missing

| # | Task | Effort | Priority | Detail |
|---|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 9.1 | **Delivery workflow controller** | 1 day | 🔴 Critical | Create `delivery.controller.ts` exposing the existing `DeliveryWorkflowService` methods as REST endpoints: `POST /api/delivery/:orderId/package` (create package), `GET /api/delivery/:orderId/packages` (list), `POST /api/delivery/:orderId/package/:packageId/deliver` (mark delivered), `POST /api/delivery/:orderId/package/:packageId/acknowledge` (client ack). Wire into api-server. |
| 9.2 | **Document selection for delivery** | 1.5 days | 🔴 Critical | In the DeliveryPackage tab, add UI to select which approved documents to include in the delivery package. Checkbox list of all order documents with category, name, QC status. Only `APPROVED` documents can be selected. "Create Delivery Package" button calls the create endpoint. |
| 9.3 | **Delivery package assembly** | 1.5 days | 🔴 Critical | Backend: when creating a delivery package, copy selected document blobs into a dedicated `delivery-packages/{orderId}/{packageId}/` path in Blob Storage. Generate a manifest JSON with document list, order metadata, timestamps. Optionally generate a cover sheet PDF (order summary, property address, appraisal value, QC pass date). |
| 9.4 | **Bulk download (ZIP)** | 1 day | 🟡 High | Endpoint: `GET /api/delivery/:orderId/package/:packageId/download` — streams a ZIP file containing all documents in the package + manifest. Frontend: wire into the "Download Complete Package" button (currently a TODO stub). Use `archiver` npm package for ZIP creation. |
| 9.5 | **Delivery status tracking** | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | Track delivery package lifecycle: `DRAFT` → `ASSEMBLED` → `DELIVERED` → `ACKNOWLEDGED`. Show timeline in DeliveryPackage tab. Update order status to DELIVERED when package is delivered. |
| 9.6 | **Client delivery notification** | 0.5 day | 🟡 High | When package is marked delivered, trigger notification via `NotificationOrchestrator`: email to client with download link, in-app notification to order stakeholders, audit trail entry. |
| 9.7 | **Delivery RTK Query endpoints** | 0.5 day | 🔴 Critical | Create `deliveryApi.ts` with RTK Query endpoints mirroring 9.1 controller routes. Tags: `DeliveryPackage`. Hooks: `useCreateDeliveryPackageMutation`, `useGetDeliveryPackagesQuery`, `useDeliverPackageMutation`, `useAcknowledgePackageMutation`, `useDownloadPackageQuery`. |
| 9.8 | **Enhanced DeliveryPackage tab** | 1.5 days | 🔴 Critical | Rewrite `DeliveryPackage/index.tsx`: fix TS error (remove `readOnly` prop or add to DocumentPanelProps), show delivery package history (list of past packages with status), show current package assembly UI (if QC approved), delivery tracking timeline, download buttons per package. |
| 9.9 | **Delivery confirmation / client acknowledgement** | 0.5 day | 🟡 Medium | UI for client to acknowledge receipt (could be a simple link in the delivery email that hits the acknowledge endpoint). Show acknowledgement status in the delivery tab. |

#### Phase 9 Summary

| Category | Tasks | Estimated Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Backend — controller + routes | 9.1 | 1 day |
| Backend — assembly + ZIP | 9.3, 9.4 | 2.5 days |
| Frontend — RTK Query | 9.7 | 0.5 day |
| Frontend — document selection | 9.2 | 1.5 days |
| Frontend — delivery tab rewrite | 9.8 | 1.5 days |
| Lifecycle + notifications | 9.5, 9.6, 9.9 | 1.5 days |
| **TOTAL** | **9 tasks** | **~8.5 days** |

**Recommended execution order:**
1. **9.1** (controller) → **9.7** (RTK Query) — get the API layer in place
2. **9.2** (document selection UI) → **9.3** (assembly backend) — core flow
3. **9.8** (rewrite delivery tab) — integrate everything
4. **9.4** (ZIP download) → **9.5** (status tracking) → **9.6** (notification) → **9.9** (acknowledgement)
