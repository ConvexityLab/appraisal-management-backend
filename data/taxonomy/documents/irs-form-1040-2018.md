IRS Form 1040 (2018) - U.S. Individual Income Tax Return
Suggest Edits

Form 1040 is the primary document for reporting a US individual's income, expenses, and tax credits to the federal government. This form is used in calculating the amount of taxes an individual owes to the government or, conversely, the size of the federal tax refund they are eligible to receive. It plays a key role in the annual tax filing process and helps individuals fulfill their tax obligations and understand their financial tax-related outcomes.

If 2019 1040 documents are not available for the applying entity’s business owners then the 2018 1040 will be an acceptable replacement as part of the PPP application.
