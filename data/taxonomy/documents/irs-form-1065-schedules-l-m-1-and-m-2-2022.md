Suggest Edits

IRS Form 1065 Schedule L is required when the partnership does NOT meet the four requirements outlined in Schedule B (Form 1065), Line 4. It is used to provide a more detailed balance sheet of the partnership's financial position when necessary.

Schedule M-1, a section of Form 1065, is where the partnership reconciles the income reported on the tax return (Form 1065) with the income recorded in its accounting records or books. This reconciliation helps ensure consistency between the partnership's financial reporting and its tax reporting.

Schedule M-2, another section of Form 1065, is where the partnership informs the IRS about the factors or events that caused changes to the partners' capital accounts on the partnership's internal books and records. It helps provide transparency regarding any adjustments made to partner capital accounts during the tax year.
