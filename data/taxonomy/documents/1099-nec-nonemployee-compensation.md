This tax form is used in the United States to report payments made to non-employees, such as independent contractors, freelancers, and other self-employed individuals for their services. Before introducing the 1099-NEC, these payments were reported on Form 1099-MISC in Box 7.

This form is used to report income that is not considered employee wages, and it includes various types of compensation, such as fees, commissions, prizes, awards, and other forms of nonemployee compensation.
