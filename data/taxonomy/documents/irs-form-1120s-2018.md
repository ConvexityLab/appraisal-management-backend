Suggest Edits

This form is used to report the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits, and other relevant financial information of a domestic corporation or eligible entity that has elected to be treated as an S corporation for tax purposes. This form is essential for S corporations to fulfill their tax obligations and report their financial activities to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). S corporations pass their income, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders, who then report these items on their tax returns.
