Suggest Edits

IRS Form 1120 Schedule L is where a corporation reports its Balance Sheet to the IRS, reflecting the financial position of the corporation as recorded in its books and records.

Schedule M-1 is required when a corporation's gross receipts or total assets at the end of the year exceed $250,000. It helps reconcile the differences between the financial income reported on the corporation's books and records and the income reported on the tax return.

Schedule M-2 is used to report the analysis of unappropriated retained earnings per book, providing a breakdown of the changes that occurred in the corporation's retained earnings over the tax year.
