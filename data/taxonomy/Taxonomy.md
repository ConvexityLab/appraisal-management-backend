 MBS margin
 One of the factors used to establish the pool accrual rate for an ARM MBS pool on each interest rate change
 date. For stated-structure ARM MBS pools, it is the difference between the lowest mortgage margin in the pool
 and the sum of the guaranty fee and the minimum servicing fee. For weighted-average ARM MBS pools, the MBS
 margin may be a fixed margin that the lender specifies or a weighted-average margin. A “fixed” MBS margin is
 attained by varying the servicing fee for individual mortgages to equalize the differences in their mortgage
 margins. A “weighted-average” MBS margin is attained by reducing the various mortgage margins by the
 applicable guaranty fee and a fixed servicing fee that the lender specifies, thus developing a different MBS
 margin for each mortgage.
