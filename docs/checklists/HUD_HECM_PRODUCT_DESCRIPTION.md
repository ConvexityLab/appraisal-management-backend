- Cash-for-keys negotiation budgets
- Carrying costs during title clearing (taxes, insurance, HOA)
- Probate and legal clearance expenses
- **Output**: Total occupancy resolution cost with timeline

**3. Current Market Value (As-Is)**
- As-is fair market value with cleared title and vacant possession
- Comparable sales adjusted for condition
- BPO and appraisal reconciliation
- Market-specific condition adjustments
- **Output**: As-is value with confidence interval

**4. Above Market Value (ARV)**
- After-repair value assuming full rehabilitation
- Estimated rehab costs to achieve ARV
- Profit spread and ROI projections
- Market positioning post-rehab
- **Output**: ARV, rehab budget, and net profit potential
