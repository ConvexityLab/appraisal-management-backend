Top 5 Missing Features from Veros Analysis
1. Reconsideration of Value (ROV) Management System ⭐ HIGH IMPACT
What it is: Formal workflow for handling appraisal challenges/disputes

ROV request intake with borrower/agent submissions
Automated triage and validation of dispute claims
Research workspace with iVALUATION-style comparable selection (up to 100 comps)
Response template builder with compliance audit trail
Timeline tracking and SLA monitoring
Decision documentation (accept/reject with rationale)
Why critical: New 2025 federal Interagency Guidance mandates formal ROV policies. Causes 7% of contract delays. We have ZERO ROV functionality.

Impact: Directly addresses compliance requirement, reduces delays, protects against discrimination claims

2. Submission Preview & Pre-Flight Validation ⭐ HIGH IMPACT
What it is: Pre-submission validation before sending to UCDP/EAD/Fannie/Freddie

Appraiser license verification (real-time check)
UAD 3.6 compliance validation (new dataset requirements)
Address standardization check
ZIP file integrity validation
Required document checklist
Image quality verification
Mock submission run before actual delivery
Why critical: UAD 2.6 → 3.6 is the biggest change in years. Submission errors cause costly revision requests and delays.

Impact: "Get it right the first time" - reduces rejection rate from 15-20% to <5%

3. Disaster Vision / Property Risk Intelligence ⭐ MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT
What it is: Parcel-level disaster impact assessment

Real-time disaster tracking (hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, floods)
Property-specific impact scores (0-100)
Portfolio exposure analysis
Automated risk alerts when disaster affects orders/collateral
Historical disaster data overlay
Insurance requirement triggers
Why critical: Climate risk is increasing. Lenders need proactive risk management. Veros offers this as add-on to AVMs.

Impact: Protects portfolio value, automates risk assessment, regulatory compliance

4. Enhanced Vendor Performance Analytics ⭐ MEDIUM IMPACT
What we have: Basic vendor tracking
What's missing:

Turn-time benchmarking (by product type, geography, rush status)
Quality score trends (QC pass rates over time)
Revision rate tracking (% requiring corrections)
Client satisfaction metrics
Geographic coverage heatmaps
Capacity forecasting (can this vendor handle 5 more rush orders?)
Comparative vendor rankings (best for full appraisals in CA)
Automatic vendor rotation based on performance
Why critical: We assign vendors but don't optimize assignments based on data

Impact: Better vendor selection, improved SLAs, reduced costs

5. UCDP/EAD Portal Integration & Status Tracking ⭐ MEDIUM IMPACT
What it is: Direct integration with GSE submission portals

Automatic submission to UCDP (Fannie/Freddie) and EAD (FHA)
Real-time status tracking (submitted → accepted → validated → errors)
Error message parsing and routing
Resubmission workflow for rejections
Compliance scoring based on GSE feedback
Audit trail for all submissions
Why critical: Manual submission to UCDP/EAD is error-prone. Veros built these portals - they know the requirements.

Impact: Automated compliance, reduced manual work, faster closings
