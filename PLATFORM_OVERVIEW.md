### 🤖 Axiom AI Platform (Core Intelligence Engine)
**Status:** ✏️ Integration in Progress

**Axiom** is our centralized AI intelligence platform that powers all document analysis, criteria evaluation, and quality assessment across the appraisal lifecycle.

**Axiom Workflow:**
```
Document Upload (PDF/XML/Images)
  ↓
Notify Axiom via API
  ↓
Semantic Chunking & Parsing
  ├─ Break documents into semantic sections
  ├─ Extract tables, images, text in context
  └─ Build knowledge graph of document structure
  ↓
Contextual Information Extraction
  ├─ Property details (address, GLA, condition)
  ├─ Comparables (sales, adjustments, values)
  ├─ USPAP compliance elements
  └─ Narrative analysis and reasoning
  ↓
Structured Criteria Evaluation
  ├─ Submit criteria + data + documentation to AI models
  ├─ AI evaluates each criterion with supporting evidence
  ├─ Generate confidence scores and reasoning
  └─ Return structured JSON results
  ↓
Persist Results & Make Available
  ├─ Store in aiInsights Cosmos container
  ├─ Link to orders, QC reviews, and audit trail
  └─ Present findings in QC review interface
```

**Integration Points:**
- ✏️ **Phase 1.2:** Property data enrichment and complexity scoring
- ✏️ **Phase 4.1:** Real-time USPAP compliance scanning during report creation
- ✏️ **Phase 5.2:** QC checklist auto-population with 70%+ automation
- 📋 **Phase 5A:** Revision comparison and change detection
- 📋 **Phase 6:** ROV comp analysis and value impact assessment

**API Contract:**
```typescript
// Notify Axiom of new document
POST /axiom/documents
{
  orderId: string,
  documentType: 'appraisal' | 'revision' | 'rov' | 'supporting',
  documentUrl: string, // Azure Blob Storage SAS URL
  metadata: { ... }
}

// Retrieve Axiom evaluation results
GET /axiom/evaluations/:orderId
Response: {
  orderId: string,
  evaluationId: string,
  criteria: [
    {
      criterionId: string,
      description: string,
      evaluation: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'warning',
      confidence: 0.0-1.0,
      reasoning: string,
      supportingData: [ ... ],
      documentReferences: [ { section, page, quote } ]
    }
  ],
  overallRiskScore: 0-100,
  timestamp: ISO8601
}
```
